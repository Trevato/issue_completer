assistant: {
  "name": "get_issue",
  "arguments": "{\n  \"issue_number\": 12\n}"
}

function (get_issue): Issue(title="implement server launching", number=12)

assistant: The issue titled "implement server launching" is about adding a feature to launch the server for the csgo tournaments.

Since this task requires changes in both the backend (FastAPI) and the frontend (React), the following steps will be followed:

- Enhance the backend server functionality to support launching.
- Implement an endpoint in FastAPI for the same.
- Finally, connect this newly created endpoint from the React based frontend.

Before I proceed with implementing this issue, could you please confirm if there are any specific requirements for the server launching feature?

assistant: The server launching feature should launch a CS:GO dedicated server with the appropriate parameters.

The server should be launched using the following command:

`./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +mapgroup mg_bomb +map de_dust2`

Let's start by creating a new endpoint in FastAPI. The endpoint should accept POST requests at `/server/launch`. The JSON body of the request should look like the following:

```
{
    "game_type": 0,
    "game_mode": 1,
    "mapgroup": "mg_bomb",
    "map": "de_dust2"
}
```

The response should contain the output of the command. If there is any error when executing the command, the response status code should be 500 and contain the error message as a string in the error field. If there is no error, the status code of the response should be 200 and contain the output of the command as a string in the output field.

assistant: Understood.

Let's start by adding this functionality to the FastAPI backend. Here is a pseudo code example for implementing the new endpoint in FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import subprocess

app = FastAPI()

class ServerLaunch(BaseModel):
    game_type: int
    game_mode: int
    mapgroup: str
    map: str

@app.post("/server/launch")
async def launch_server(launch: ServerLaunch):
    command = f"./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon +game_type {launch.game_type} +game_mode {launch.game_mode} +mapgroup {launch.mapgroup} +map {launch.map}"
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        return {"output": output}
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=e.output)
```

This code defines a new model `ServerLaunch` for handling JSON body of the request and declares a new POST endpoint `/server/launch`. The endpoint runs the server launching command and returns its output.

After updating the backend, we can then proceed to connect this endpoint with React frontend.

For the fronted work, which programming language or library is being used for managing state and sending network requests like this one? Do you use Redux, React Query, or something else?

assistant: We're using Redux along with Redux Thunk for managing state and sending network requests.

Could you write an action creator for a Redux Thunk action that sends a POST request to the `/server/launch` endpoint please?

The action should dispatch an action with type `SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST` before making the request. If the request is successful, it should dispatch an action with type `SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS` and payload equal to the response from the server. If the request fails, it should dispatch an action with type `SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE` and payload equal to the error message.

The following is the Fetch API for making requests:

```javascript
fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
})
    .then((response) => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then((data) => {
        // use data
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error);
    });
```

assistant: Certainly, here is an example of how you would structure your Redux thunk action creator for sending a POST request to the /server/launch endpoint:

```javascript
// Action types
const SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST = 'SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST';
const SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS = 'SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS';
const SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE = 'SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE';

// Action creator
const serverLaunch = (payload) => async (dispatch) => {
  // Dispatch request action
  dispatch({ type: SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST });

  // Send POST request
  fetch('/server/launch', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  })
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    // Dispatch success action with server response as payload
    dispatch({ type: SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS, payload: data });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Dispatch fail action with server response as payload
    dispatch({ type: SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE, payload: error.toString() });
  });
}
```

This structure fits Redux thunk actions. It makes a request when the action is dispatched, and dispatches either a success action or a failure action based on the result of this request, updating the Redux store appropriately.

assistant: Would you like me to implement the reducer for these actions as well? The reducer would be responsible for returning the new state according to the dispatched actions. We can consider three states: loading, success, and failure.

assistant: Yes, please do that. The initial state should be:

```
{
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    output: null,
}
```

If an action with type `SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST` is dispatched, the new state should be:

```
{
    loading: true,
    error: null,
    output: null,
}
```

If an action with type `SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS` is dispatched with payload `output`, the new state should be:

```
{
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    output: output,
}
```

If an action with type `SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE` is dispatched with payload `error`, the new state should be:

```
{
    loading: false,
    error: error,
    output: null,
}
```

assistant: Sure, here is the Redux reducer based on the given requirements:

```javascript
// Initial state
const initialState = {
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  output: null,
};

// Reducer
const serverLaunchReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST':
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: true,
        error: null,
        output: null,
      };

    case 'SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS':
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        output: action.payload,
      };

    case 'SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE':
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        error: action.payload,
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export default serverLaunchReducer;
```

In this reducer:
- It first checks the action type.
- If the action type is `SERVER_LAUNCH_REQUEST`, it sets `loading` to `true` to indicate that a request is in progress.
- If the action type is `SERVER_LAUNCH_SUCCESS`, it sets `loading` to `false` and updates `output` with the payload of the action.
- If the action type is `SERVER_LAUNCH_FAILURE`, it sets `loading` to `false` and `error` to the payload of the action.
- For any other action type, it returns the current state as is.

}

function (get_issue): Issue(title="Style TournamentDetail component", number=13)

assistant: The "Style TournamentDetail component" issue aims at enhancing the appearance of the TournamentDetail component in the React frontend.

As designing and styling will involve frontend frameworks like CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, or any other depending on your project, could you please provide more details on how you would like the design and layout of the TournamentDetail component to be? E.g., color schemes, specific layouts, font styles, or any existing design systems you follow would be helpful.

Are there any UI/UX specifications or style guides I should adhere to while styling this component?

assistant: For the TournamentDetail component, let's follow a card-based design similar to what Material UI provides.

The card should have the tournament name as the title at the top. This should be followed by the tournament details. Each detail should have the detail name as the title and the detail description as the description. The details include the tournament date, number of teams, and prize pool.

The color scheme should match that of CS:GO which is a mix of black, white, and orange. The typography should be clean and modern, something like Roboto, Arial, or Helvetica would fit. There should be no excessive spacing anywhere. The component should respond nicely to mobile devices as well, maintaining its margin and padding.

The Delete Tournament and Edit Tournament buttons should be at the bottom of the card. The Edit button should be styled as an outlined button and the Delete button should be styled as a contained button with the color red to signify a destructive action. When the Delete button is clicked, a dialog should open asking the user to confirm their action.

In terms of CSS-in-JS, we're making use of styled-components. Please make sure all the styling is done via styled-components.

Please also update the tests for this component after making these changes.

Could you create a pull request with these changes?
